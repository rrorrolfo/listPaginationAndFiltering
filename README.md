<h3 align="center">Usage of web development technique "pagination"</h3>
<p>Pagination is used to make it easier for an user to find information within a website and to read it.</p>
<p>This project is built using a "progressive enhancement" development approach, meaning that the website is not dependant upon the added JavaScript. The JavaScript has been added to paginate and improve the project without altering the project in such a way that the JavaScript becomes required to use or view the web page</p>


<h2 align="center">How to use</h2>

<p>If Javacript is enabled, the user can write a name or email in the search box, the results matching the search term will be displayed, and if the results are more than 10, they will be paginated with 10 results maximum per page.</p>
